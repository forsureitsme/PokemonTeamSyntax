Syntax highlighting for Pokemon Team's importables in Sublime Text, by setting the syntax on the lower right corner, or saving the file with the .pktm extension.

It was roughly tested in ST3 only. Please, help me out in testing it in other editors, such as ST2 and TextMate.

## Install

It's recommended to install it through [Package Control](http://packagecontrol.io), since it can update automatically when new releases are available. However, you can manually install it by [downloading it](https://github.com/forsureitsme/PokemonTeamSyntax/releases) and extracting to your Packages Folder([Preferences > Browse Packages](http://i.imgur.com/T2Qyuaz.jpg)).

## Contribute

Don't edit the ``PokemonTeamSyntax.tmLanguage``, it needs to be built with ``build.js`` script.
You may edit any properties of ``PokemonTeamSyntax.sublime-completions`` file, except the ``completions`` one, since the build script is going to overwrite it.

```shell
# Install node, or make sure it's installed by running:
node -v

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/forsureitsme/PokemonTeamSyntax.git
npm install
npm start
```
